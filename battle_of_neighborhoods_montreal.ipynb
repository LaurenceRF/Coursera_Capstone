It's an island that cuts the Saint Lawrence River in half. For this project, we will consider all the neighborhoods of the island of Montreal.\n\n16 years ago, Montreal lost its baseball team, the Montreal Expos. The team was moved to Washington D.C. At the end of the 1990s, Expos slowly disapperead from Montreal's sports landscape. Baseball fans lost interest in their team. That led to the relocation of the Expos.\n\nThe major reason for this failure was the poor location of the Olympic Stadium. The stadium was far from population centres, restaurants, and bars. Basically, there was nothing to do around the stadium before and after the game. People could not eat at a good restaurant before the game and have a drink after.\n\nFor 5 years, private investors have been looking to bring baseball back in town and to acquire a Major League Baseball (MLB) team for Montreal. The condition from the MLB for a return of baseball in Montreal is a new stadium. For such a project, public investments from the government are needed.\n\nThe goal of this project is to present to the Montreal City Council the optimal location for a new baseball stadium so public funds can be allocated to the project. The private investors need the help of data science to convince the Council of the optimal location.\n\nFor a location to be optimal, there must have restaurants and bars around the stadium. We will use a clustering model to cluster neighborhoods based on their similarities. We will make sure that the selected location does not share the same cluster as the old Olympic Stadium."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "To address our problem, we will need the following information:\n* **Density of population** : We want the stadium to be in a neighborhood with a high-density population. In Montreal, neighborhoods with big population are well served by public transportation and we want the stadium to be easily accessible. Having a lot of people living around the stadium would also evoke a sense of belonging to the team.\n* **Number of restaurants in the neighborhood**\n* **Number of bars in the neighborhood**\n    \nTo define the neighborhoods of Montreal, we will use postal codes. The list of postal codes of Montreal can be found here:\n[Wiki Montreal Postal Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_H) Some postal codes are not used. They will be ignored.\n\nCoordinates of neighborhoods will be obtained using geocoder. Exactly like we did in the previous lab.\n    \nRestaurants and bars in each neighborhood will be obtained with the help of Foursquare API. We will explore each neighborhood to get the most popular venues.\n\nFor density of population, we can use Statistics Canada 2016 Census. Each postal code has its corresponding population :\n[Population and dwelling counts](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&T=1201&S=22&O=A) We will extract the population for each postal code of our dataset.\n\nTo create a map of Montreal using Folium, Montreal shape file is available here : [Montreal shapefile](https://jmacman12.carto.com/tables/montreal_shapefile/public)"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
